## GEMINI API
 Fixes & Enhancements
âœ” Newlines (\n) now show as new lines using <br>
âœ” Bullet points (- or â€¢) will now appear correctly
âœ” Text formatting looks more natural
The issue happens because the AI response contains bullet points (â€¢, -, or \n newlines), but HTML doesnâ€™t recognize \n inside {{ msg.text }}.

âœ… Solution: Use innerHTML and Format Text Properly
Modify the div inside chat-messages to render the text correctly.

Whatâ€™s New?
âœ” Full-width layout (max 600px for readability)
âœ” Modern chat bubble styling (blue for user, gray for AI)
âœ” Auto-scrollable messages area
âœ” Bigger input field & button for better usability
âœ” Press Enter to send messages
 Improvements:
âœ… Full-width chat container
âœ… Styled messages (User & AI) with colors
âœ… Better input & button styling
âœ… Smooth scrolling for messages
