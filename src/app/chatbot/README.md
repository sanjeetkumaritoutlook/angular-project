## GEMINI API
 Fixes & Enhancements
✔ Newlines (\n) now show as new lines using <br>
✔ Bullet points (- or •) will now appear correctly
✔ Text formatting looks more natural
The issue happens because the AI response contains bullet points (•, -, or \n newlines), but HTML doesn’t recognize \n inside {{ msg.text }}.

✅ Solution: Use innerHTML and Format Text Properly
Modify the div inside chat-messages to render the text correctly.

What’s New?
✔ Full-width layout (max 600px for readability)
✔ Modern chat bubble styling (blue for user, gray for AI)
✔ Auto-scrollable messages area
✔ Bigger input field & button for better usability
✔ Press Enter to send messages
 Improvements:
✅ Full-width chat container
✅ Styled messages (User & AI) with colors
✅ Better input & button styling
✅ Smooth scrolling for messages
